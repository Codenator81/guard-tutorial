title:  KnpUGuard: Symfony Authentication with a Smile
summary: |
    Symfony's authentication is definitely powerful, but if you
    need to do something complex, you might pull your hair out.

    No more! In this tutorial, we'll see how KnpUGuard authentication
    works and use it to build a system with both a login form *and*
    the ability to read API tokens.

    Doing this will be pretty easy. But more importantly, you'll have
    all the hook points you'll ever need to meet whatever crazy authentication
    system you have.
