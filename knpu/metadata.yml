title:  KnpUGuard: Symfony Authentication with a Smile
summary: |
    Symfony's authentication is definitely powerful, but if you
    need to do something complex, you might pull your hair out.

    Introducing KnpUGuard authentication, which puts all the complexities of any
    authentication scheme right at your finger-tips. The code you right will be
    easy to understand and customizing things to any whim will be simple:

    * Authentication via an API token
    * "Social login" / OAuth authentication
    * Creating a traditional login form
    * Customizing success/failure behavior
    * Customizing error messages
    * Loading users in complex ways
    * ... probably anything else

    If all goes well, Guard will become a core part of Symfony. If you like it, let
    people know it worked for you at [symfony/symfony#14673](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/14673).
    And if it doesn't cover a use-case, [open an issue](https://github.com/knpuniversity/KnpUGuard)
    and let me know!
